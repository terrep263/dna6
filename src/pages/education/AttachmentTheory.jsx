            <h2>What is Attachment Theory?</h2>
            <p>
              Attachment theory, developed by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, explains how the bonds we form with our primary caregivers in early childhood shape our relationships throughout life. These early experiences create internal working models that influence how we approach intimacy, trust, and emotional connection.

              <h3 className="text-blue-900 font-semibold mb-2">üí° Key Insight</h3>
              <p className="text-blue-800">
                Your attachment style isn't fixed - it can change through self-awareness, therapy, and healthy relationships. Understanding your patterns is the first step toward transformation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Four Attachment Styles</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Secure Attachment (The Healthy Foundation)</h3>
            <p>
              People with secure attachment feel comfortable with intimacy and independence. They trust easily, communicate openly, and handle conflict constructively. They make up about 50-60% of the population.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Comfortable with emotional closeness</li>
              <li>Trust others and themselves</li>
              <li>Handle rejection and conflict well</li>
              <li>Set healthy boundaries</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment (The Worrier)</h3>
            <p>
              Anxious individuals crave intimacy but fear abandonment. They often worry about their partner's feelings and may become clingy or demanding in relationships.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Intense fear of abandonment</li>
              <li>Need constant reassurance</li>
              <li>May become clingy or needy</li>
              <li>Overthink relationship dynamics</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Avoidant-Dismissive Attachment (The Independent)</h3>
            <p>
              Avoidant people value independence over intimacy. They may seem emotionally distant and struggle to open up or commit to relationships.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Value independence over closeness</li>
              <li>Difficulty expressing emotions</li>
              <li>May seem emotionally distant</li>
              <li>Struggle with commitment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Fearful-Avoidant Attachment (The Conflicted)</h3>
            <p>
              Fearful individuals want close relationships but fear getting hurt. They may push people away while simultaneously craving connection.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Desire intimacy but fear rejection</li>
              <li>Push-pull behavior in relationships</li>
              <li>Difficulty trusting others</li>
              <li>May sabotage good relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How This Affects Your Dating Life</h2>
            <p>
              Your attachment style influences everything from who you're attracted to, how you communicate, to how you handle breakups. Understanding your patterns can help you:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Recognize unhealthy relationship dynamics</li>
              <li>Choose partners who complement your style</li>
              <li>Communicate more effectively</li>
              <li>Build healthier relationship habits</li>
            </ul>

            <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-6 my-6">
              <h3 className="text-green-900 font-semibold mb-2">üå± Growth Opportunity</h3>
              <p className="text-green-800">
                If you identify with anxious or avoidant patterns, remember that change is possible. Many people successfully develop more secure attachment through self-work and healthy relationships.
              </p>
